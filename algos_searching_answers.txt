Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.
  fib(0) = 0
  fib(1) = 1
  fib(2) = (0 + 1) = 1
  fib(3) = (1 + 1) = 2
  fib(4) = (1 + 2) = 3
  fib(5) = (2 + 3) = 5
  fib(6) = (3 + 5) = 8
  fib(7) = (5 + 8) = 13
  fib(8) = (8 + 13) = 21 
  fib(9) = (13 + 21) = 34
  fib(10) = (21 + 34) = 55 
  fib(11) = (34 + 55) = 89
  fib(12) = (55 + 89) = 144
  
Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
  A binary search only works with sorted collections of items. So given the option to use either a binary search or a linear search for an unsorted collection of items, you would have to use the linear search.
  For performance reasons, it would be better to use an iterative solution rather than a recursive solution.
Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
  Given the option to use either a linear search or a binary search for a sorted collection, it would be more efficient to use a binary search with and average case of O(log n).
  Even though a recursive solution may look more elegant and, at times, more readable code, it would be better to use an iterative solution rather than a recursive solution for performance reasons.
